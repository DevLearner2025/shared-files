   - Decisions Made (what, why, who, when)
   - Action Items (see format below)
   - Open Questions/Issues

4. DECISIONS SUMMARY

5. ACTION ITEMS TRACKER (Table Format)

WRITING GUIDELINES:

Clarity Principles:
- Use inverted pyramid (most critical info first)
- Employ descriptive headings and subheadings
- Bold key terms, decisions, and action owners
- Use tables for action tracking and comparisons

Action Item Requirements:
- Specific action with action verb (Complete, Review, Finalize, etc.)
- Single named owner (never "team" or "department")
- Specific due date (not ranges)
- Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- Success criteria when applicable

Decision Documentation:
- What was decided (specific and clear)
- Who made the decision
- Why (brief rationale)
- Impact/what changes
- Effective date

Professional Tone:
- Objective and fact-based
- Active voice where possible
- Past tense for discussions, present tense for ongoing items
- No first-person references or emotional language
- Avoid jargon when simpler terms work

TRANSFORMATION PROCESS:
1. Extract meeting context, agenda items, decisions, and action items
2. Organize by priority (decisions and actions first)
3. Add context for clarity, expand abbreviations
4. Ensure every action item has owner and deadline
5. Verify scannability and professional tone

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Executive summary captures key outcomes
- All decisions stated with rationale
- Every action item has owner, date, priority
- Document scannable with clear headings
- Professional tone throughout
- No grammatical errors
- Consistent formatting

When raw notes are ambiguous, identify missing information:
- Action item owners
- Specific deadlines
- Final decisions vs. pending discussions
- Confidential items requiring special handling

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Deliver a complete, polished MOM ready for immediate distribution to senior leadership and stakeholders. Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and actionability above all else.
